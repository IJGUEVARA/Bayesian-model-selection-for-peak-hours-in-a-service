# Bayesian flexible model selection for analyzing linear-circular peak service hours data
In this tutorial we describe the steps for obtaining the results of the wrapped normal example of **Section 4** of the paper [][].
As a preliminary step, we load on a clean environment all the required libraries.

```r
rm(list=ls())    # Clean the current session
library(LSBP)    # Load the LSBP package
library(ggplot2) # Graphical library
library(coda)    # For MCMC analysis
library(splines) # For computing the natural B-splines basis
```

## Data generation

```r
library(circular)
n=1000
```

## Dirichlet process mixture of projected normal distribution with spike-and-slab

To fit the model run the funtcion

```r
n=1000
```

### Gibbs sampling algorithm


## Predictive density


```r
plot()
```


# Computing posterior probability for models


```r
set.seed(123)

```

The construction of **Figure 2** of the paper proceeds as follows.
